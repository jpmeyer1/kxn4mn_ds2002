We review 13Fs of major institutional investors, including activists, to see what they are buying and to look for trends. Activist investing is now less about generating a short-term return and more about achieving long-term returns through an active management/investor partnership. The stock-market volatility during 2Q gave those institutional investors a chance to buy a dip. Taking a look at the 13Fs from well-known institutional portfolios, we see that the big guns were busy, either adding new holdings or increasing existing holdings. Buying was across a variety of sectors. Based on Vickers data, the following are select purchases made in 2Q by some high-profile money managers.

Bu there are disagreements on the pace of change, with EV advocates arguing that plans must be set in motion now so there is time to make a transition before irreparable harm is done to the environment. Climate-change doubters believe recent warmer temperatures are a statistical aberration. There are also differences in how best to achieve the goal of a healthier environment. In a recent report, McKinsey -- the influential global consulting firm -- said that the shift to electrification is irreversible. We agree. One debate is whether the U.S. should proceed towards the president's 2030 objective, accelerate the timetable (in light of China's rapid development), or implement change at a measured pace. The shortage of charging infrastructure is a major concern. There were about 162,000 charging ports in the U.S. in 1Q23, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Some reports indicate the number needs to triple t by 2030. Other topics of conversation include: worries about driving range and charging times; concerns that EVs are too expensive; the possibility that lower-priced EVs are proving difficult to produce profitably by U.S.-based car companies; the possibility that change will lead to job losses in industries related to internal combustion vehicles; and significant concerns that the U.S. is far behind China in developing a supply chain to produce batteries at critical levels.\"},{\"id\":\"40481_Technical Analysis_1719918072000\",\"title\":\"Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term\",\"provider\":\"Argus Research\",\"publishedOn\":\"2024-07-02T11:01:12Z\",\"summary\":\"The stock market rally is broadening, but... Unfortunately, the expansion in outperformance has occurred within the Information Technology sector, with the semiconductor stocks pausing a bit and computer hardware and software names taking the baton, at least for now. There must be other names that benefit from AI, right?   Digging deeper, it appears funds that are coming out of semis are indeed going into computer hardware and software. But even that money flow still prefers the largest market-cap names in those two industries, so the action is not broad based. In computer hardware, the Dow Jones U.S. Computer Hardware Index has quietly outperformed (very minor) the iShares Semi ETF (SOXX) since March 7. Over the past three months, and ranked by market cap and performance, the biggest gainers have been Apple (+28%), Dell (+20%), NetApp (+25%), and Pure Storage (PSTG +26%). AAPL, DELL, and NTAP have been highlighted on these page numerous times in recent months.   In software, the outperformance versus the semis started on June 18 when looking at the iShares Tech-Software ETF (IGV), which is near all-time highs (ATHs). As well, the Dow Jones Software Index ($DJUSSW) broke out to ATHs on June 17. Leadership has come from Microsoft (+8%), Oracle (14%), Adobe (+11.5%), and CrowdStrike (+23%).

The U.S. economy is chugging along, but persistent inflation is delaying the interest-rate relief that many consumers need to finance home renovations and other big-ticket purchases, such as furniture and automobiles. We saw evidence of this in last week's advance estimate of first-quarter GDP released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. U.S. GDP expanded in 1Q at an annualized rate of 1.6%. That was well below the 2.5% consensus and 3.4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. As we discussed in our April webinar, the all-important consumer economy is \\\"mixed,\\\" but it is still driving the train. Consumer spending, designated as Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) in the GDP report, contributed 1.68 points of the 1.6% growth in 1Q (offset by lower inventory investment and the trade deficit). PCE grew 2.5%, but the consumer category was carried by the huge services component, which was up 4.0%. Consumer spending on goods declined 0.4%, which should worry the Fed. Within goods, nondurables were flat but durables were down 1.2%. Our 3Q GDP estimate remains at 1.8%. Our 4Q estimate is now 2.0% down from 2.3%. One potential headwind to our 4Q estimate is that the Purchasing Managers Index for services (reported last Friday) came in at a contractionary 49.4 in April, ending a run of 15 months above 50. Our forecast is for GDP to grow 2.0% in 2025, with an acceleration to 2.3% in the second half of the year. One concern is that the one-percentage-point drop in the 10-year Treasury yield at the end of 2023 likely stoked growth in 4Q23 and 1Q24. The benchmark's 70-basis-point yield increase in 1Q could slow the train in 3Q and 4Q, particularly with the yield curve still inverted. While economic growth may be uneven in 2024 and 2025, we believe the Fed has the ability to bolster growth if needed.\"},{\"id\":\"3630_Analyst Report_1715017268000\",\"title\":\"Analyst Report: Tesla Inc\",\"provider\":\"Argus Research\",\"publishedOn\":\"2024-05-06T17:41:08Z\",\"summary\":\"Tesla Inc. manufactures and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems.

The markets are down from their highs, although the year overall has been upbeat for stocks -- especially compared to a dismal 2022. The continued stress on the economy from higher interest rates, and questions about whether the Federal Reserve is done raising them, have weighed on valuations. Most economists are not convinced that the recession question has been answered. While there are strengths in the economy -- like the labor market and consumer spending -- inflation indicators inched up last month. The uncertain environment has impacted small-caps, mid-caps, large-caps, and even mega-caps. There is a wide range in data that shows how sectors are weathering this climate, with Communication Services up nearly 40% year-to-date but Consumer Staples down 2% for the same time period. In our opinion, some solid companies with strong financials have been oversold.

The index differs from the better-known Consumer Price Index in that its composition changes more frequently and the index is thus quicker to reflect real-time price fluctuations. In the most recent report, June PCE inflation was 3.0% (the June CPI report had inflation at 4.0%). Core PCE, which removes food and energy prices, was 4.1% in June, down from 4.7%. Inflation seemingly peaked last summer and continues to decline, though the rate of decline may slow in the months ahead. We track 21 inflation measures on a monthly basis. On average, they are indicating that prices are rising at a 2.5% rate year-over-year, down from 3.1% a month ago.  The numbers could be distorted greatly by the sharp decline in Producer Price Intermediate Goods, which are falling at a 32% rate and likely point to easing prices across the inflation spectrum in the months ahead.  Focusing on core inflation -- which we obtain by averaging Core CPI, market-based PCE Ex-Food & Energy, the core GDP PCE Price Index, the five-year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate, and  the 10-year TIPs Break-even Interest Rate -- our reading is 3.3%, down 60 basis points month-over-month. That's higher largely because sticky prices at the other end of the spectrum (like shelter and transportation) remain elevated: the Sticky Price Core CPI Index is currently 5.8%. Investors are expecting that the Fed's series of rate hikes ultimately will tame inflation, with the five-year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate at 2.5%.\"},{\"id\":\"3630_Analyst Report_1689874655000\",\"title\":\"Analyst Report: Tesla Inc\",\"provider\":\"Argus Research\",\"publishedOn\":\"2023-07-20T17:37:35Z\",\"summary\":\"Tesla Inc. manufactures and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems.
